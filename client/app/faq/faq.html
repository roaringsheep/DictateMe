        <h4>No Rhythm?!</h4>
        <p>No, this app does not dictate rhythm. Unfortunately accuracy comes with the cost of slow speed and no ability to dictate rhythm.</p>

        <h4>This app sucks. It doesn't do anything right.</h4>
        <p>Here are some ways to improve its guess.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimizing the background noise will reduce the unfortunate trill dance.</li>
          <li>Keep it to reasonable range please! It will not recognize any notes higher than three octaves above the middle C.</li>
          <li>If the guess skips over a lot of notes, try singing (or humming) slower. It works the best when each note is sung slower than 80bpm. (<a target="_blank" href="http://metronomeonline.com">Metronome</a>) There is no reason to sing faster or in rhythm anyways since it doesn't dictate rhythm.</li>
          <li>The pitch recognition library is optimized for human voice. Singing or humming works the best with this app.</li>
          <li>Lastly, please use the reference pitch and take care not to sing around quarter tones. It's your fault for hanging out there, not the poor program's fault trying to correct your tuning. This will also reduce the unfortunate trill dance.</li>
        </ul>

      	<h4>How do I edit?</h4>
      	<p>The edit syntax consists of the note name and octave number. For example, middle C is C4, A above middle C is A4, etc. It also takes accidentals, up to single sharp or a flat. This app does not support double sharps or double flats. Also, please make sure to separate each note with a comma.</p>

      	<h4>I still have questions.</h4>
